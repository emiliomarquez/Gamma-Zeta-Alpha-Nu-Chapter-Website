      <p class="alumniquestion">What was the reason you joined Gamma Zeta Alpha?</p>
      <blockquote> I really liked the idea of being part of an organization that prioritizes academics and likes to give back to the community.  Before joining Gamma Zeta Alpha I was not that excited about the brotherhood portion mainly because I did not know the true meaning of it.  Once I started the process I realized that brotherhood is the most important value the fraternity has to offer.  You will not understand brotherhood until you experience the entire process.  Brotherhood is built through time and requires trust and commitment from all brothers, especially after you cross.  I like the fact that I can go to any of our chapters at any time and be treated like family.  That is one of the main qualities that make us stand out from other organizations.</blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What have you done after graduation?</p>
      <blockquote>Moving to Michigan in 2010 allowed me to expand my education and work experience.  I obtained my Masters Degree in Electric Vehicle Engineering in 2013 and have acquired valuable work experience in the automotive industry.  I'm currently working at the Ford Motor Company as a Design and Release Engineer.  I work in their Electrified Powertrain Engineering division developing new architectures and designs for high voltage electrical systems utilized in hybrid and electric vehicles.</blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">How has Gamma Zeta Alpha benefited you as a person or your professional career?</p>
      <blockquote>The leadership and excellence that Gamma Zeta Alpha demands played a vital role in my life.  Before joining this fraternity I had the fear of public speaking and struggled every time I had to present in front of a crowd.  Taking leadership roles in the fraternity such as Treasurer, Dean of Membership Intake, and President forced me to overcome those fears as well as learn how to become self-disciplined.  Today, I use those skills on a daily basis at work and have no problems presenting in front of big shots.  Always keep in mind that you will get back what you put into the fraternity; therefore, I encourage every active brother to give 110% everydayâ€¦you'll be surprised with all the things you can accomplish and the positive impact you'll have on other brothers and the fraternity.</blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What was your favorite memory from the fraternity?</p>
      <blockquote>The night we crossed is one of the unforgettable memories I have.  Crossing with all my line brothers and sharing that accomplishment made the entire process worthwhile.  Not only did we make history by establishing the Nu chapter but also helped lay a strong foundation for future brothers to build on.  Seeing the chapter thrive and become stronger each year with the addition of new brothers gives me great satisfactions and makes me look forward to its future. </blockquote>
