      <p class="alumniquestion">What was the reason you joined Gamma Zeta Alpha?</p>
      <blockquote>Coming out of high school I had a lot of questions about the world and the kind of man I wanted to be. When I met the gentlemen of Gamma Zeta Alpha they reminded me of home and, more importantly, of all the people who had helped to make me who I was. I really felt comforted by the way they interacted, and it truly felt like what they had established was a true brotherhood. I knew I had to be a part of it and leave my mark in the organization. </blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What have you done after graduation?</p>
      <blockquote>  Since graduation I have been home enjoying some long overdue time with my family. Furthermore, I have been able to continue my passion for wrestling, both by coaching at the high school level and by competing in local competitions. I have also been contributing to our Sigma Chapter at Cal Poly Pomona by participating in community service events and fundraisers the brothers have hosted. As I enjoy my time at home, I am also preparing myself to start graduate school in the fall. I will be pursuing a Master of Social Work at the University of Southern California. </blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">How has Gamma Zeta Alpha benefited you as a person or your professional career?</p>
      <blockquote>The fraternity has helped me developed into the best I can be, be it in my professional or personal life. I have learned a lot about professionalism, from giving presentations, to having successful interviews. It has also helped me to become an effective leader. On a personal level, my brothers have seen me through some of the highest and lowest points of my life, and I know I wouldn't be where I am at today if it weren't for them. </blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What was your favorite memory from the fraternity?</p>
      <blockquote> It really is hard to pick a single moment in my experiences that could top them all, but I think as of this past weekend at our 11 year formal, one in particular stands out. I will always remember being honored with the alumni of the year award. Since the day I crossed into the fraternity I swore that I would give my best to my brothers, and that I would always watch their backs. That award shows that my brothers have recognized my commitment to them.</blockquote>
