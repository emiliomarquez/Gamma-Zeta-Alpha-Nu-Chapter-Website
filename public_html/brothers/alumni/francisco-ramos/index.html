      <p class="alumniquestion">What was the reason you joined Gamma Zeta Alpha?</p>
      <img width="200" class="right" src="http://gammazetaalpha.ucsd.edu/images/alumni-campaign/founding/francisco-ramos/InterestGroup.jpg"><blockquote>As a transfer student coming into UCSD, I found it challenging to find where all my Latinos were.  I remember asking myself, did I make the right choice in coming here?  Fast forward a few months and I was introduced to a couple guys who shared with me their thoughts in forming an interest group and future founding class of Gamma Zeta Alpha, Nu Chapter.   I opted to partake in a meeting and, although not initially sold on the time commitment, I was fully bought into the genuineness of the gentlemen around me. I have a strong belief in faith and fate and somehow knew that this was going to be completely worthwhile… and it was.  Gamma Zeta Alpha not only embraced the values of brotherhood, but helped encourage its members to excel in academics, to invest in our communities through philanthropy and to enjoy our college years! To date, some of the best memories I own also belong to the many brothers who brought them to life.  As a founding father of the chapter and first ever chapter President, it makes me proud to know that our chapter continues to prosper because of the hard work and dedication of its active members and alumni’s.  </blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What have you done after graduation?</p>
      <blockquote>I graduated from UCSD in 2005 (yikes – that went by fast).  Initially, I moved back to Los Angeles where I was born and raised.  I joined an advertising and marketing firm out there and quickly realized that work life balance doesn’t exist when you’re a young buck paying your dues.  I also realized that Los Angeles was too big of a market for my compacted area of expertise – Communications/Marketing.  I moved back to San Diego and joined Wells Fargo Bank at a retail store.  I had to humble myself and begin in an entry-level position as a personal banker.  I most certainly had a giant “I have a degree” chip on my shoulder.  I thought that my degree should have been enough to get me a great position – I was wrong.  It would be hard work, dedication and leadership skills that would get me ahead. I have been with Wells Fargo since then holding several roles in store management, learning and development and district leadership.  Today, I live in Orlando, Florida and run the marketing division of Wells Fargo Bank for community banking in the Central Florida Region.   </blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">How has Gamma Zeta Alpha benefited you as a person or your professional career?</p>
      <img width="195" class="right"src="http://gammazetaalpha.ucsd.edu/images/alumni-campaign/founding/francisco-ramos/BigBro.jpg"><blockquote>I am a proud, first-generation Mexican-American and, as such, have been raised to have strong cultural values and an impeccable work ethic.  Gamma Zeta Alpha helped further develop these learnings and truly help me master my skills as a leader.  Getting a fraternity chapter started is no small task and one that required lots of discipline, organization and brother encouragement.  College itself prepares you by creating some routines that you’ll carry with you throughout the rest of your life.  The fraternity provides you with a platform to elevate your leadership and influencing skills; 2 of the most important weapons in your arsenal while navigating your professional life.  </blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What was your favorite memory from the fraternity?</p>
      <img width="200" class="right" src="http://gammazetaalpha.ucsd.edu/images/alumni-campaign/founding/francisco-ramos/GammaBeach.jpg"><blockquote>As I mentioned earlier, I have many fond memories of my time as a Triton Gamma.  One that I look back on often and laugh is our time spent at Juan Lopez’s ranch.  We spent lots of time there – whether it was hanging out, grilling out or finding new and creative ways to prank each other, the weekends spent there are unforgettable and hilarious.  It was also there, along with a few other places that our brotherhood began to grow roots.  We built the foundation of what we wanted this chapter to be, how we wanted to be viewed by others and what legacy we wanted to create.    </blockquote>
