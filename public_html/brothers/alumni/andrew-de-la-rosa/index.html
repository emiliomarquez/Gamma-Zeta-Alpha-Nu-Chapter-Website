      <p class="alumniquestion">What was the reason you joined Gamma Zeta Alpha?</p>
      <blockquote>     Being the only one from my high school to go to UCSD was a huge challenge for me and so I wanted to join an organization to have a sense of belonging and a positive outlet at UCSD.  I made my choice to join the fraternity because of how well each brother carried themselves and the positive things that they gave to the local community.  Also after learning more about the Fraternity the brotherhood that was displayed was and is incredible and so that was just another great reason to become part of this organization.</blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What have you done after graduation?</p>
      <blockquote>   After graduation I have stayed in San Diego establishing my career and currently work for both UCSD and the VA Hospital as a Data Manager.    In my current role I provide data tools for researchers who work with active duty military to find causes and treatment techniques for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  My current position has allowed me to take my education and turned it into something positive that may be beneficial for future military members. </blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">How has Gamma Zeta Alpha benefited you as a person or your professional career?</p>
      <blockquote>Without the fraternity I feel like I would not be as successful as I am today.  The organizational structure and business aspects showed me so much.  Prior to joining the organization I tended to be a shy individual, the fraternity helped me grow from that to be a leader.  The fraternity helped me to understand and deal with many commitments as you do after graduation and I am so thankful to my brothers who help me along the way.</blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What was your favorite memory from the fraternity?</p>
      <blockquote>    I have many great memories from the fraternity and continue to create new ones.    If I had to choose one it would be the day our Alpha Class became brothers of our fraternity.  As a founding member one of my goals was to work hard to have a successful first class that would help us establish a foundation our chapter.  Seeing them cross was one of our greatest goals as an organization and years of work that finally paid off.  Alpha class was just the beginning and each time a new class is established is another great achievement for our chapter.</blockquote>
