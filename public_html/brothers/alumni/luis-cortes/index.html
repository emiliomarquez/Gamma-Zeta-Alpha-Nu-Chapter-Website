      <p class="alumniquestion">What was the reason you joined Gamma Zeta Alpha?</p>
      <blockquote>As far as I knew, I was the first person from my high school to attend UCSD, which was a massive change demographically—I went from being one of many, to being a decisive minority. I sought out other people like me, with similar backgrounds and cultural experiences for support. I quickly found my ‘big bro’ in the fraternity (Jose Covarrubias) and the rest, as they say, is history.</blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What have you done after graduation?</p>
      <blockquote>  After graduation (immediately after), for financial reasons, I joined the service sector in the California Conservation Corps where I excelled at unprecedented rate—professional skills I learned as a true Gamma—so that in six (6) months I had reached the highest pay rate possible in the entire state, being one of only two people to have ever done so. After my year of service, and becoming an AmeriCorps Scholar, I was admitted into the PhD program at UCSD in Literature, where I currently specialize in English Romanticism and the forfeiture of the self. </blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">How has Gamma Zeta Alpha benefited you as a person or your professional career?</p>
      <blockquote>As a person, working with the organization taught me valuable life lessons, ranging from professionalism to patience. As a person, the organization taught me that I can surpass anything or overcome any challenge, I am my biggest obstacle. My professional career benefited because of the academic support and motivation I received from my brothers—verily, I did the best in school during the years I was most active in the fraternity and held executive board positions, which by necessity meant time management was crucial for success. </blockquote>
      <p class="alumniquestion">What was your favorite memory from the fraternity?</p>
      <blockquote> My life has been a blur of fantastic moments with incredible brothers who have forever shaped and altered my life in a positive way. Primarily, I will always miss those late nights with my line brothers, endless nights of studying, preparing, and bonding. I do not like to live in nostalgia; therefore arguably, my favorite memories with the organization are presently being created with the new members and ever growing chapter. I feel a great sense of pride to see those brothers whom are my legacy (members whom I brought into the organization) become the leaders and role models of our chapter.</blockquote>
